# HCPex
An extended Human Connectome Project multimodal parcellation atlas of the human cortex and subcortical areas

HCPex is an extended version of the original atlas in which 66 subcortical areas (33 in each hemisphere) have been added, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus, mammillary bodies, septal nuclei and nucleus basalis. HCPex makes available the excellent parcellation of cortical areas in HCP-MMP v1.0 to users of volumetric software such as SPM and FSL, as well as adding some subcortical regions, and providing labelled coronal views of the human brain.

Please note that the HCPex is not published yet, and will not make it available before publication. However, we allow members of ISTBI to ask for a pre-release version, which should not be distributed to anyone else until it is published. Please write an email to czhuang@psy.ecnu.edu.cn and copy to Edmund.Rolls@oxcns.org to ask for access to the HCPex prerelease version.

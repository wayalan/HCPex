The extended HCP-MMP atlas is provided in the asymmetric MNI standard space of the ICBM152 2009c T1 template. The cortical regions in this atlas are adopted and reordered based on the HCP-MMP v1.0 atlas and the CortexID provided in the Supplementary Material File NIHMS68870-supplement-Neuroanatomical_Supplementary_Results.pdf of Glasser et al (2016). 52 new subcortical parcellations (26 in each hemisphere) are added in HCPex after the cortical regions.

Please noted that the HCPex is not publish yet, and will not make it available before publication. However, we allow members of ISTBI to ask for a pre-release version, which should not be distributed to anyone else until it is published. Please write an email to czhuang@psy.ecnu.edu.cn and copy to Edmund.Rolls@oxcns.org to ask for access of the HCPex prerelease version.
